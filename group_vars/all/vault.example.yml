#
# Keep vaulted variables safely visibleÔÉÅ
# You should encrypt sensitive or secret variables with Ansible Vault. However,
# encrypting the variable names as well as the variable values makes it hard to 
# find the source of the values. You can keep the names of your variables accessible 
# (by grep, for example) without exposing any secrets by adding a layer of indirection:
#
# 1   Create a group_vars/ subdirectory named after the group.
# 2   Inside this subdirectory, create two files named vars and vault.
# 3   In the vars file, define all of the variables needed, including any sensitive ones.
# 4   Copy all of the sensitive variables over to the vault file and prefix these variables with vault_.
# 5   Adjust the variables in the vars file to point to the matching vault_ variables using jinja2 syntax: db_password: {{ vault_db_password }}.
# 6   Encrypt the vault file to protect its contents.
# 7   Use the variable name from the vars file in your playbooks.
